# DSA Notes

This repository is a personal collection of **Data Structures and Algorithms notes**
maintained for **consistency, practice, and revision**.

The content includes:
- Short explanations of problem-solving approaches
- Personal observations and common pitfalls
- Reference implementations in C++

The goal is not originality or completeness, but regular practice
and clarity of thought.

## Structure
- Problems are grouped loosely by topic
- Each entry contains:
  - Core idea / intuition
  - Approach
  - Code
  - Time and space complexity

## Language
- C++

## Disclaimer
All explanations and implementations are written by me
for learning and educational purposes.
Problems discussed are standard and commonly available on
public coding platforms.

## Usage
Feel free to browse, but this repository is primarily
maintained as a personal problem-solving journal.
